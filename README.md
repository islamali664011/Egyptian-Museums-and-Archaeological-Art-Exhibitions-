 I have completed the Egyptian Museums and Archaeological & Art Exhibitions Management System project, which is considered the first project of its kind using SQL. It is an integrated database system designed to act as the digital brain for managing Egypt’s museums entirely. The system manages the lifecycle of Egyptian heritage inside these museums, starting from the moment an artifact is registered, through its display, maintenance, and loan processes, all the way to tracking visitors and related cultural activities.
Project Idea:
The project aims to connect all components of the museum ecosystem into one unified, relational database. The system starts with the Museums table, which represents the foundation. It stores data about each museum such as location, type, establishment year, and website. From this table, the rest of the system branches out, reflecting the real structure of cultural institution management.
The project focuses on three main pillars:
Material Heritage through the Artifacts table, which records artifact details (material, condition, type).
Cultural Presentation through the Exhibitions table, which manages temporal and thematic exhibitions inside museums.
Human Resources through the Staff table, which documents employees, job levels, and academic backgrounds.
The system adds realistic operational depth through smart supporting tables such as:
Artifact_Exhibition to link artifacts to exhibitions and track display duration.
Visitors to analyze visitor behavior and classify them by categories and ticket types.
Loans to record artifact loan movements between cultural institutions worldwide.
Maintenance to track maintenance and restoration history for each artifact.
Auction to document artifacts that entered auctions and their market values.
From an analytical perspective, by populating the system with official datasets, decision-making can be supported through intelligent queries such as:
Analyzing visitor numbers per museum, material distribution in artifacts, average staff age, ranking museums by visitor traffic, and analyzing ticket patterns using CTE and Views.
The real strength of the project lies in reflecting a realistic model for managing cultural heritage using Relational Database Design, while applying professional database concepts such as Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Transactions, Aggregations, Views, and CTE.
If you want, I can rewrite it in a stronger CV style, LinkedIn style, or academic research style.
